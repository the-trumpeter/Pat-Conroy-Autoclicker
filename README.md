another "brilliant" app by the-trumpeter

My friend made 'Pat Conroy Clicker' game.\
I made an autoclicker to cheese it.


really quick important info:\
Minimum OS version: MacOS Sequoia 15.0 (untested but should work fine). The application was tested and developed on MacOS Tahoe 26.0 Beta.\
Install: Find your way to 'Releases' on the sidebar, there should be something labelled 'Latest Release'; click on that, and there should be a `dmg` file somewhere.\
Any problems/questions/ideas please contact by opening either an Issue (for problems/bugs) or a Discussion (for everything else).
