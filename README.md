another "brilliant" app by the-trumpeter

My friend made 'Pat Conroy Clicker' game.\
I made an autoclicker to cheese it.




### really quick important info:
**Minimum OS version:** MacOS Sequoia 15.0 (untested but should work fine). The application was tested and developed on MacOS Tahoe 26.0 Beta.

**Install:** Find your way to 'Releases' on the sidebar, there should be something labelled 'Latest Release'; click on that, and there should be a `dmg` file somewhere.
It will need permission to 'control your computer', you should be prompted to allow this when you start clicking (make sure to turn clicking back off before you go off to follow the prompt, otherwise you will be nastily suprised as soon as it is granted permission).

**Any problems/questions/ideas** please contact by opening either an Issue (for problems/bugs) or a Discussion (for everything else).
